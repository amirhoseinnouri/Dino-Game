# A short introduction about the code

___
This project features a simple yet addictive Dino Jump game, inspired by the Google Chrome offline dinosaur game. Developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the game allows players to control a pixelated dinosaur that must jump over obstacles like cacti and birds. The objective is to survive as long as possible while the game speeds up over time, increasing the challenge.

Key features include:

Responsive Design: The game adapts to various screen sizes, ensuring an enjoyable experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
Score Tracking: Players receive points for every obstacle successfully jumped over, with a score display that updates in real-time.
Smooth Animations: JavaScript is used to create smooth animations for the dinosaurâ€™s jump and the movement of obstacles, enhancing the gameplay experience.
Game Over Screen: When the dinosaur collides with an obstacle, a game-over screen appears, allowing players to restart the game easily.
This project serves as an engaging way to practice JavaScript while providing a fun and interactive experience for users.
enjoy it :)
